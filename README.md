# Introduction

I created this repository to record links to learning resources, TLA
files, and notes while I learned about
[TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).


# Learning TLA+


## Leslie Lamport's TLA+ video course

The home page of this course is
[here](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html).  All
videos in this course can also be viewed via [this
list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p54W-XOIEF8&list=PLWAv2Etpa7AOAwkreYImYt0gIpOdWQevD)
on YouTube.

The directory
[`lamport-tlaplus-video-course-material`](lamport-tlaplus-video-course-material)
in this repository contains `.tla` files mentioned in the course.
